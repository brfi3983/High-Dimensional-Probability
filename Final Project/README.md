# APPM 5515 - High Dimensional Probability for Data Science
During this course, we covered various probability methods such as *Concentration of Random Variables*, *Random Matrices*, and *Sub-Gaussian/Sub-Exponential Distributions* within the book [High-Dimensional Probability: An Introduction with Applications in Data Science](https://www.math.uci.edu/~rvershyn/papers/HDP-book/HDP-book.html).
